# Worldmap
web app to present infos about countries etc. Countries can be found from the map or from the list.

Gives the user the possibility to mark visited countries and to add countries to a personal wishlist and move countries between wishlist and visited list. There is also a small countries-capitals-quiz to check the knowledge.

To run the app go to main folder (Worldmap) and type in command line: json-server --watch db.json --port 3004 and later, in another cmd line tab, type in: npm start

The app uses external API to get countries info, uses react-simple-maps library to present the data on the map and json-server to keep users data (wishlist and visited countries list).
